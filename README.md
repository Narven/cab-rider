Cab Rider, Uber clone app with Flutter.

> This is based on the course [Build UBER Clone App Using Flutter and Firebase (2020)
](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-uber-clone-app-with-firebase)

This was originaly the result of the course "Build UBER Clone App Using Flutter and Firebase (2020)"
from Udemy. Since the course is a good real live example, but currently outdated.
I've done the course till the end once, I'm doing it now again while refactoring it.
